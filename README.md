#9.Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) 
as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

#16.Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than . 
Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
'N4' is equvivalent to 4 places as .1234 similarly 'N3'is .123
/*Important to round up values*/
select format(LONG_W,'N4') from station where lat_n = 
(select max(lat_n) from station where lat_n < 137.2345137);

#17.Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
select format(lat_n,'N4') from station where lat_n = 
(select min(lat_n) from station where lat_n >38.7780);

#18.Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. 
Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
select format(LONG_W,'N4') from station where lat_n = 
(select min(lat_n) from station where lat_n >38.7780);

#19.ConsiderP1(a,b)  andP2(c,d)  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

SELECT FORMAT(ABS(MIN(LAT_N)-MAX(LAT_N))+ABS(MIN(LONG_W)-MAX(LONG_W)),'N4') FROM STATION;


#20. Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


SELECT CASE WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
            WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
            WHEN A = B OR A = C OR B = C THEN 'Isosceles'
            ELSE 'Scalene'
